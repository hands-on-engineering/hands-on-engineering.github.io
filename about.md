Hello everyone, and welcome to Hands On Engineering!

[Our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCENsrYk8n9EKb4PY6B0s82A/featured) is dedicated to providing comprehensive and understandable tutorials on everything from circuit design to robotics. Videos will be split into multiple parts that follow individual labs. Formal lab documents will be provided in the descriptions of each video. If you have any ideas for future labs please leave suggestions in the comment sections or send us a message and we will try to incorporate them into future videos.

We hope these tutorials provide valuable instruction and help to improve your current and future projects!

The Hands On Engineering Team:

Prof. Aaron Ridley (Space),  Robby Buechler (Mech. Eng.), Evan Bunker (Aero),  Evan Gonzalez (Aero),  Rohan Kanuru (Mech. Eng.), Samuel Lopez (Aero), Scott Smith (Elec. Eng.), and Joshua Synowiec (Space).

Our channel is made possible through a grant provided by the National Science Foundation.
